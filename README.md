# AetheBot for Discord

## Setup

Install [Yarn Classic](https://classic.yarnpkg.com) (1.x). Yarn is a hard
*requirement* for AetheBot, `npm` will not work, and support for `npm` is not in
scope for this project.

Current required version of Node.js is specified in `.node-version`.

Create a Discord Bot account 
[here](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me).

Copy the token it generated.

Create a `development.env` file in the root of this repo.

Inside this file, paste the token like this:

```
DISCORD_TOKEN=[token]
```

## Debugging in Visual Studio Code

### With Node Installed

If you've got Node installed on your system, either via `nvm`, `nodenv`, or
compiling it manually, you should just be able to run the debugger by pressing
F5 in Visual Studio Code. Make sure you've run `yarn install` first! Also, make
sure the configuration in the debugger tab (drop down, top left) is set to 
"Launch Using System Node".

### Running Node Inside Docker

Change to the debugger tab and change the configuration (drop down, top left)
from "Launch Using System Node" to "Launch in Docker (Debug Bot)". The first time 
you run this you will need to pull down all the `node_modules` compiled against 
the Linux that runs in Docker:

```
rm -rf node_modules
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml run bot yarn install
```

Now you can go back into Visual Studio Code and press F5 to start. Note that
when running in Docker, it runs the Bot process and the Website process as
completely separate node processes, which communicate with each other via a 
Redis PubSub channel. By default, Visual Studio Code will attach its debugger 
to the Bot process, you can change this by using the "Launch in Docker (Web)" 
configuration instead.

The node processes running in Docker will automatically restart when the code
is recompiled. You can automate this to happen whenever you modify a TypeScript
file by running `yarn tsc -w` on your host.

The website will run under http://localhost:8080

## Creating a Voice Noise

The voice noises themselves are in an object in 
`src/features/voicenoise/noises.ts`. Provide the file name for the noise to
play, and a regular expression to match on. It will play the noise in the
channel you are currently in if the regex matches and you've mentioned the bot.
Please keep try to keep the volume of your noise consistent with the other
noises.

Noises can be provided in `.opus` format, 64kbps mono. Please listen to some of
the existing voice noises and adjust the volume accordingly.
